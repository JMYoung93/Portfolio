# <Portfolio>
## Description
This is my portfolio assignment for week 3 of our boot camp. I had a hard time setting up my main "cards" that take up the body of the webpage, and also setting up my active background. Adding a photo in the "About Me" section also altered my page and affected my nav bar to the point where I couldn't figure out how to revert it back into a row rather than a column. Other than that, I am happy with the basic structure of my page. I will continue to change it and make changes to the structure of the page since I don't consider this the absolute final product. It was fun to build this with others in my class, and I feel as though my biggest setback was trying to add more style to the page than functionality. I wanted something unique that would stand out to potential employers.
