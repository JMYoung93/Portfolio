                    <p>
                        Current student at UCSD Extension for a Full Stack Flex Coding Boot Camp. 
                        Current graduation expected date is March 2022. I grew up in Escondido, CA until I was 20 and joined the United States Army where I was honorably discharged in 2016. 
                        I then went on to work for the State of California as an Office Assistant with the California Highway Patrol for four years while attending college classes at night. 
                        I have earned two Associate's degrees using my GI Bill in Arts(2020) and Sociology(2021). I decided to pivot careers into coding and have loved every minute of it since. 
                        I love to learn new languages and how computers think in order to help make applications and design web content. 
                    </p>   
                    
                    <p>
                        Currently looking for an Entry-Level position or internship that is willing to help mold my growing knowledge of coding into a more honed skill set that can be put to use  
                        for you! While I am a current student, what I lack in experience I make up for in drive and passion for learning. After several years in the military and public sector, I believe 
                        that I have the necessary adaptation skills to overcome and obstacles that are placed in front of me to grow within a company.  
                        I don't back away from challenges, but embrace them to become better. If it is difficult, I want to do it.
